### Hello There ðŸ‘‹
I am a graduate international student in Computer Science at <b>San Francisco State University</b>. I have experience working on my website and various database projects, using languages such as Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. Additionally, I have completed over 100 LeetCode questions to further improve my skills. During an internship where I worked with Java, I was the team lead and utilized tools such as Eclipse. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing football, PC gaming, and cycling. I also have experience working with an NGO in India, and am interested in collaborating on any projects that will allow me to learn and grow.
